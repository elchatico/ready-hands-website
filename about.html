    <p>
      Ready Hands Initiative is a youth-led first aid training program founded in Kenya. Our mission is to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and courage to respond confidently in emergencies — both in school and at home.

    <p>
      We believe that young people don’t have to wait to become doctors to save lives. Through practical, engaging, and school-friendly sessions, we are training the next generation of lifesavers.
